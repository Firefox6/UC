## Requirements

**Allow 'Untrusted Shortcuts'** on your device by going to `Settings â†’ Shortcuts`.

The shortcut is only working on **iPhone** models running **iOS 14.3** or **higher** as the '*Set Wallpaper*' action was (re)introduced in this version.

## Setup

Before UC can work, we need to make sure all images are in the correct folders.

### Get everything set up ###
On your iPhone, click on the link below for the installer shortcut. Run it to download and extract all files. Once completed, you can delete the installer shortcut again.

## Automate

**UC does not update your wallpaper automatically by default**. You can either choose to **manually trigger this shortcut** every time you want your wallpaper to update **OR** you can choose to **use automations** to trigger the shortcut.

[Create your own automations to your preferences](https://support.apple.com/guide/shortcuts/create-a-new-personal-automation-apdfbdbd7123/ios) and add a 'Run Shortcut' action. Choose the UC Shortcut to run and you're set.

Recommended is to run UC approximately every halve an hour (unless you use acurate time modules). Alternatively you can choose to run the shortcut every time you open/close one of your most used apps (also through Automations) to make sure your wallpaper is updated from time to time. 

**IMPORTANT NOTE** 
Running this shortcut too frequently through some automations (e.g. Every time I open app, run shortcut) can have a negative impact on the battery life of your device.

## Creating your own module
It is possible to create your own module. More info available at [/docs/theming.md](../main/docs/theming.md).

## FAQ

- **The wallpapers seem to be pixelated / low quality?**

Depending on your device, the shortcut needs to resize the original images to fit your screen and uses overlay actions to apply modules. In this process, the quality of the images seems to be reduced, causing blurry or pixelated results in some cases. There is nothing I can do to solve this.

- **Will you make more modules?**

**Probably.** Depending on my personal life and spare time, there probably will come more modules over time.

- **Is this shortcut 'battery hungry'?**

**No.** Only your automations will define how much resources will be used. If you e.g. run the shortcut every 10 minutes, there will be a noticeable effect on your battery life. 

- **Do you accept paid assignments to create a custom module?**

**Everything is negotiable** but it is not my intention to start creating private modules for the highest bidder.
